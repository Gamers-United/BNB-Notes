# Description
The Caves & Nether Portal located beneath the Mushroom Kingdom is a mysterious and intriguing labyrinth of underground tunnels and passageways. This hidden world provides quick transport to other nearby towns via the nether, making it an essential part of the kingdom's infrastructure.

For those brave enough to venture below the surface, the caves offer excellent mining opportunities with depths that reach as far down as bedrock. This is where the kingdom's most skilled miners can be found, harvesting precious minerals and resources from the earth.

But the caves are not just for mining. The presence of a Nether Portal within their depths allows for quick transport to other parts of the world, making it a vital tool for commerce and exploration. Adventurers and traders can travel from the Mushroom Kingdom to far-off lands with ease, opening up new opportunities for trade and discovery.

The Caves & Nether Portal are a true marvel of the Mushroom Kingdom, offering a wealth of resources and opportunities for those who dare to venture below the surface. Whether it's for mining, exploration, or travel, this hidden world is an integral part of the kingdom and its continued success.
