# Description
The Villager Quarry is a massive open pit in Minecraftia that stretches deep into the earth. At the edge of the quarry stands a towering crane used to move heavy stone blocks, while a complex network of minecarts leads deep into the bowels of the earth, where rich minerals and ores can be extracted. With its steep walls and cavernous depths, the Villager Quarry is a testament to the ingenuity and determination of the villagers who operate it.
