# Description
The communal nether portal of Joe's Classic Village is the primary gateway for travelers entering and leaving the village. It is built into a small hill constructed of Blackstone, cobblestone, tuff and deepslate. A pillager banner notes its location and danger. The portal serves as the main mode of transportation for those looking to explore the surrounding lands. It is a crucial part of the village's infrastructure, making it easy for people to trade, travel and connect with the wider Minecraft world.
