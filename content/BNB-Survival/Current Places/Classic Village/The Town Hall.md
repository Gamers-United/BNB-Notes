# Description
The town hall of Joe's classic village is a warm and inviting space. A cosy fireplace takes center stage in the room, creating a comfortable atmosphere. The enchanting table, surrounded by bookshelves, is also present in the town hall for all of the villagers to use. 
However, rumours persist of unknown secrets below the town hall that can only be accessed by dying to the skull on the wall. Some say that the secrets are guarded by dark magic and the bravest of villagers dare to venture down to the unknown depths. Whether the rumours are true or not, the town hall remains a central gathering place for the villagers of Joe's classic village.
