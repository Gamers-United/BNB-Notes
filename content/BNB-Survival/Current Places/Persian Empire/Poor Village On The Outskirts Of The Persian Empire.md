# Description
Poor village on the outskirts of the Persian Empire is a small, isolated community nestled on the side of a snowy mountain. The majority of the buildings in the town are made of wood, giving it a warm and homely feel despite its rough exterior. The most prominent structures in the village are the Blackstone tower and the grain silo, which rise above the rest of the houses and provide a sense of stability and security. Despite these sturdy buildings, there is a collapsed house that sits at the edge of the village, serving as a reminder of the harsh conditions that the residents face. The village overlooks the town of Danada, visible across the mountain crest, offering a glimpse of the wider world beyond the village's borders.

# Persian Lore Part 1
Morbidity spread across the crowds of the hungry. The humans were ferocious, wilder than the animals they hunted themselves.

The famine reigned across the Persian Empire, causing chaos to span across the land.
A winter like no other struck this once prosperous land of pride and virtue, swiftly, like the ancient spears of Tehran as they rained down on the soldiers of Israel many years ago on this mountainous terrain.

King Ardeshir III lost all control over his people and himself, lost some sanity. But all hope was not lost.

A young man, covered in ragged clothes appeared before the king with an idea... to save the hungry. This lonely soul was known by Sam by many in the lands of Lebanon.

Stories of him were in the hearts of many throughout the Middle East of his heroic acts that saved the masses of humans from the plains of Syria to the mountains of Afghanistan from hunger.
He brought forth his secret recipe of a meal so great it was known to keep the hungry fed for a millennia.

**The Snack Pack...**

A meal consisting of meat brought from all across the lands, and mixed with the finest sauces from India. This recipe was forged in the Great Chicken Shop Of Dural, a rich kingdom in the north.

With this recipe, Sam single-handedly had helped King Ardeshir III to save the hungry and keep his kingdom thriving for years to come. 
But King Ardeshir III knew that this wouldn't be his only challenge.

Something was coming. An evil would come...

A threat of war daren't impel the perception to appertain disadvantageous through the mind attributed to a king unless countered by an opportunity to conquer
