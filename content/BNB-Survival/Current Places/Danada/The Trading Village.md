# Description

In addition to the mending villager, the trading village is home to the main sugarcane farm, providing the town with a valuable source of food and resources.

The Eucalyptus forest that surrounds the trading village creates a serene and peaceful environment, and the soft rustling of the leaves in the wind provides a soothing background noise.

In short, The trading village is a vital outpost in the heart of the Eucalyptus forest, providing essential resources and services to the residents of Danada and the surrounding area.

# Unsavoury Conditions

The conditions at the outpost are unacceptable and inhumane. The presence of a slave camp where villagers are not free to leave and are forced to perform labour such as making enchantment books is a gross violation of their human rights.

The conditions in which they are living are deplorable, with a constantly leaking roof and a floor made of soil. To make matters even worse, the slaves are forced to sleep outside with minimal protection, exposing them to the elements and further exacerbating their suffering. 

These conditions are a result of the commitment of Danada to highest efficiency in enchantment book and villager production. It is a necessity in order to allow for the production of cheap goods for the citizens of Danada.
