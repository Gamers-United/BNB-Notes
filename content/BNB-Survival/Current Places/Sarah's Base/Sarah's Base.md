# Description
Sarah's base is a charming little lakeside cottage, perched on a rocky outcropping and surrounded by dense shrubbery. The cottage is small and cosy, with smoke billowing from the chimney, adding to its inviting atmosphere. Despite its modest size, the cottage exudes a sense of comfort and serenity, offering a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of the outside world.

One of the most notable features of the cottage is the large azalea tree that looms overhead, casting a dappled shadow across the eloquently planted flowers surrounding the cottage. The tree is a stunning sight, with its vibrant pink blossoms and lush green leaves, providing a beautiful backdrop to the cottage.

Along the lakeside, sugarcane grows in neat rows, adding to the idyllic atmosphere of the cottage. The sound of the water lapping at the shore provides a soothing background noise, while the rocky outcropping offers a stunning view of the surrounding landscape.

In short, Sarah's base is a tranquil and serene retreat, offering a peaceful escape from the world and the perfect place to relax and unwind.
