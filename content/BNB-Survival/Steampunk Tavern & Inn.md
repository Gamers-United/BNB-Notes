## History
The Steampunk Tavern & Inn, built by blaze_mex, was first established in the early days of Minecraftia. Nicolas, a skilled builder and engineer, saw the need for a unique and welcoming establishment for travelers and locals alike. He combined his love for technology and Victorian aesthetics to create a one-of-a-kind building that still (partially) stands to this day.

The tavern was built using cutting-edge technology of the time, with a large copper roof and calcite walls. The walls were made of calcite, a rare mineral that was abundant in the area, which was known for its durability and beauty. The copper roof was a work of art, featuring intricate designs that caught the eye of everyone who saw it.

The tavern quickly became a popular spot for locals and travelers, who were drawn to its warm and inviting atmosphere. The tavern was equipped with the latest technology, including a music box and potion brewery, which made it a true marvel of the time.

However, as the years went by and the community moved on, the Steampunk Tavern & Inn fell into disrepair. The once thriving establishment became run down and abandoned, as newer, more modern establishments popped up around it. The copper roof and calcite walls, once a marvel of the time, now showed the signs of decades of neglect and the aftermath of many severe local storms. The repairs were extensive and costly, leading to the Steampunk Tavern & Inn's closure.
