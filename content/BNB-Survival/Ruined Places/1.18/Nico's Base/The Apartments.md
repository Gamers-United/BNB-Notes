# History
The multi-level apartment complex was once a unique and ambitious structure, drawing inspiration from pipe apartment buildings and featuring a cylinder design that was unlike anything seen before. Despite its striking appearance, the complex was not well-loved by many people due to its unusual shape, and over time it began to fall into disrepair. The green-coloured first floor, blue-coloured second floor, yellow-coloured third floor, orange-coloured fourth floor, magenta-coloured fifth floor, and red-coloured sixth floor each showed signs of neglect and neglect, their vibrant hues fading over time.

At the top of the building was a large sign made of copper and concrete, with the letters "pn" inscribed on it. This sign once stood tall and proud, symbolising the complex's unique identity. However, as the years passed, the sign began to deteriorate, until it was nothing more than a faded memory of what once was.

Despite the building's unique design and vibrant colours, it was eventually forgotten and left to crumble beneath the shifting landscape. Over time, the once-proud structure became buried and crumpled, a forgotten relic of a time gone by. Now, the only evidence of its existence is the faint outline of its foundation, buried beneath the ground and forgotten by all but the most observant of travelers.
