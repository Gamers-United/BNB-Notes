The majority of the buildings in the town are made of wood, giving it a warm and homely feel despite its rough exterior. The most prominent structures in the village are the Blackstone tower and the grain silo, which rise above the rest of the houses and provide a sense of stability and security. Despite these sturdy buildings, there is a collapsed house that sits at the edge of the village, serving as a reminder of the harsh conditions that the residents face. The village overlooks the town of Danada, visible across the mountain crest, offering a glimpse of the wider world beyond the village's borders.\n\n# Persian Lore Part 1\nMorbidity spread across the crowds of the hungry. The humans were ferocious, wilder than the animals they hunted themselves.\n\nThe famine reigned across the Persian Empire, causing chaos to span across the land.\nA winter like no other struck this once prosperous land of pride and virtue, swiftly, like the ancient spears of Tehran as they rained down on the soldiers of Israel many years ago on this mountainous terrain.\n\nKing Ardeshir III lost all control over his people and himself, lost some sanity. But all hope was not lost.\n\nA young man, covered in ragged clothes appeared before the king with an idea... to save the hungry. This lonely soul was known by Sam by many in the lands of Lebanon.\n\nStories of him were in the hearts of many throughout the Middle East of his heroic acts that saved the masses of humans from the plains of Syria to the mountains of Afghanistan from hunger.\nHe brought forth his secret recipe of a meal so great it was known to keep the hungry fed for a millennia.\n\n**The Snack Pack...**\n\nA meal consisting of meat brought from all across the lands, and mixed with the finest sauces from India. This recipe was forged in the Great Chicken Shop Of Dural, a rich kingdom in the north.\n\nWith this recipe, Sam single-handedly had helped King Ardeshir III to save the hungry and keep his kingdom thriving for years to come. \nBut King Ardeshir III knew that this wouldn't be his only challenge.\n\nSomething was coming. An evil would come...\n\n# \"War\"\nA threat of war daren't impel the perception to appertain disadvantageous through the mind attributed to a king unless countered by an opportunity to conquer\n-King Ardeshir III","lastmodified":"2023-02-04T05:41:27.441722314Z","tags":null},"/BNB-Survival/Ruined-Places/1.18/Nicos-Base/Steampunk-Tavern-Inn":{"title":"Steampunk Tavern \u0026 Inn","content":"\n## Original State\n-  Source: 1.18 SMP concluding 18/05/22\n-  Builder: Nicolas Aguayo Perez (blaze_mex)\n-  Coordinates: 2700, -3000\n-  Township: Nico's Base\n![](BNB-Survival/images/nico_house_og.png)\n## Current State\n-  Coordinates: -1600, 250\n![](BNB-Survival/images/nico_house_current.png)\n## History\nThe Steampunk Tavern \u0026 Inn, built by blaze_mex, was first established in the early days of Minecraftia. Nicolas, a skilled builder and engineer, saw the need for a unique and welcoming establishment for travelers and locals alike. He combined his love for technology and Victorian aesthetics to create a one-of-a-kind building that still (partially) stands to this day.\n\nThe tavern was built using cutting-edge technology of the time, with a large copper roof and calcite walls. The walls were made of calcite, a rare mineral that was abundant in the area, which was known for its durability and beauty. The copper roof was a work of art, featuring intricate designs that caught the eye of everyone who saw it.\n\nThe tavern quickly became a popular spot for locals and travelers, who were drawn to its warm and inviting atmosphere. The tavern was equipped with the latest technology, including a music box and potion brewery, which made it a true marvel of the time.\n\nHowever, as the years went by and the community moved on, the Steampunk Tavern \u0026 Inn fell into disrepair. The once thriving establishment became run down and abandoned, as newer, more modern establishments popped up around it. The copper roof and calcite walls, once a marvel of the time, now showed the signs of decades of neglect and the aftermath of many severe local storms. The repairs were extensive and costly, leading to the Steampunk Tavern \u0026 Inn's closure.","lastmodified":"2023-02-04T05:41:27.441722314Z","tags":null},"/BNB-Survival/Ruined-Places/1.18/Nicos-Base/The-Apartments":{"title":"The Apartments","content":"## Original State\n-  Source: 1.18 SMP concluding 18/05/22\n-  Builder: Mac Lim (xXMagmaHDXx)\n-  Coordinates: 2600, -3050\n-  Township: Nico's Base\n![](BNB-Survival/images/apartments_og.png)\n## Current State\n-  Coordinates: 2500, 2700\n![](BNB-Survival/images/apartments_ruined.png)\n# History\nThe multi-level apartment complex was once a unique and ambitious structure, drawing inspiration from pipe apartment buildings and featuring a cylinder design that was unlike anything seen before. Despite its striking appearance, the complex was not well-loved by many people due to its unusual shape, and over time it began to fall into disrepair. The green-coloured first floor, blue-coloured second floor, yellow-coloured third floor, orange-coloured fourth floor, magenta-coloured fifth floor, and red-coloured sixth floor each showed signs of neglect and neglect, their vibrant hues fading over time.\n\nAt the top of the building was a large sign made of copper and concrete, with the letters \"pn\" inscribed on it. This sign once stood tall and proud, symbolising the complex's unique identity. However, as the years passed, the sign began to deteriorate, until it was nothing more than a faded memory of what once was.\n\nDespite the building's unique design and vibrant colours, it was eventually forgotten and left to crumble beneath the shifting landscape. Over time, the once-proud structure became buried and crumpled, a forgotten relic of a time gone by. Now, the only evidence of its existence is the faint outline of its foundation, buried beneath the ground and forgotten by all but the most observant of travelers.","lastmodified":"2023-02-04T05:41:27.441722314Z","tags":null}}
