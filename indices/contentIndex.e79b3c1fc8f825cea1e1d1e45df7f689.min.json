Nicolas, a skilled builder and engineer, saw the need for a unique and welcoming establishment for travelers and locals alike. He combined his love for technology and Victorian aesthetics to create a one-of-a-kind building that still (partially) stands to this day.\n\nThe tavern was built using cutting-edge technology of the time, with a large copper roof and calcite walls. The walls were made of calcite, a rare mineral that was abundant in the area, which was known for its durability and beauty. The copper roof was a work of art, featuring intricate designs that caught the eye of everyone who saw it.\n\nThe tavern quickly became a popular spot for locals and travelers, who were drawn to its warm and inviting atmosphere. The tavern was equipped with the latest technology, including a music box and potion brewery, which made it a true marvel of the time.\n\nHowever, as the years went by and the community moved on, the Steampunk Tavern \u0026 Inn fell into disrepair. The once thriving establishment became run down and abandoned, as newer, more modern establishments popped up around it. The copper roof and calcite walls, once a marvel of the time, now showed the signs of decades of neglect and the aftermath of many severe local storms. The repairs were extensive and costly, leading to the Steampunk Tavern \u0026 Inn's closure.","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T00:40:51.958494085Z","tags":null},"/BNB-Survival/Ruined-Places/1.18/Nicos-Base/The-Apartments":{"title":"The Apartments","content":"## Original State\n-  Source: 1.18 SMP concluding 18/05/22\n-  Builder: Mac Lim (xXMagmaHDXx)\n-  Coordinates: 2600, -3050\n-  Township: Nico's Base\n![](BNB-Survival/images/apartments_og.png)\n## Current State\n-  Coordinates: 2500, 2700\n![](BNB-Survival/images/apartments_ruined.png)\n# History\nThe multi-level apartment complex was once a unique and ambitious structure, drawing inspiration from pipe apartment buildings and featuring a cylinder design that was unlike anything seen before. Despite its striking appearance, the complex was not well-loved by many people due to its unusual shape, and over time it began to fall into disrepair. The green-coloured first floor, blue-coloured second floor, yellow-coloured third floor, orange-coloured fourth floor, magenta-coloured fifth floor, and red-coloured sixth floor each showed signs of neglect and neglect, their vibrant hues fading over time.\n\nAt the top of the building was a large sign made of copper and concrete, with the letters \"pn\" inscribed on it. This sign once stood tall and proud, symbolising the complex's unique identity. However, as the years passed, the sign began to deteriorate, until it was nothing more than a faded memory of what once was.\n\nDespite the building's unique design and vibrant colours, it was eventually forgotten and left to crumble beneath the shifting landscape. Over time, the once-proud structure became buried and crumpled, a forgotten relic of a time gone by. Now, the only evidence of its existence is the faint outline of its foundation, buried beneath the ground and forgotten by all but the most observant of travelers.","lastmodified":"2023-02-07T00:40:51.958494085Z","tags":null}}
